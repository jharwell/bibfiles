abstract="A new cluster resource management system called Simple Linux Utility Resource Management (SLURM) is described in this paper. SLURM, initially developed for large Linux clusters at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), is a simple cluster manager that can scale to thousands of processors. SLURM is designed to be flexible and fault-tolerant and can be ported to other clusters of different size and architecture with minimal effort. We are certain that SLURM will benefit both users and system architects by providing them with a simple, robust, and highly scalable parallel job execution environment for their cluster system.",

abstract="Teaching robotics to engineering students can be a challenging endeavor. In order to provide hands-on experiences, physical robot platforms are required. Previously, obtaining these platforms could be expensive, and required a lot of technical expertise from teaching staff. However, more recent models address these issues, therefore providing more opportunities for hands-on sessions. In this paper, we describe how we used the Turtlebot 3 mobile robot in master courses at KU Leuven. We provide an overview of the main functionalities, and suggest a number of improvements to further lower the learning curve for students. Additionally, we elaborate on the curriculum and learning outcomes of two courses that utilized Turtlebots in practically oriented sessions.",
