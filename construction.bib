abstract = {A collective construction task require a multi-robot system to search for randomly distributed building blocks and push those blocks to some predefined locations. To address this problem, a bio-inspired swarm intelligence based algorithm is proposed for a distributed multi-robot system to combine explorative searching and dynamic task allocation together for collective construction. Basically, a virtual pheromone trail based method is proposed as the message passing mechanism among the robots, where robots make distributed movement decisions through local interactions. Since blocks may need multiple robots to work together, dynamic task allocation among robots is necessary. A modified Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method is proposed to balance the exploration and exploitation, which helps to allocate reasonable robots to different target blocks. The simulation results in multi-robot construction task demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method.},

The objective is to achieve a partitioning that minimizes the workload imbalance between the robots and maximizes assembly parallelization. The algorithm consists of three phases: 1) an initial allocation of the subtasks to each robot via a variant of Dijkstra's algorithm; 2) a component trading protocol to balance each robot's workload without violating any constraints; and 3) the creation of an assembly plan for each robot that minimizes conflicts during execution. We present simulation results for three variants of the algorithm and experiments using our multi-robot testbed.},

Based on these properties, a fitness function is defined to characterize the structured patterns that can be generated by the model. The fitness function assigns a value to each pattern. The choice of the fitness function is validated by the fact that human observers tend to view patterns with high (resp. low) fitness as structured (resp. unstructured). A genetic algorithm based on this fitness function is used to explore the space of possible patterns. The genetic algorithm is able to make use of sub-modules of existing patterns and recombine them to produce novel patterns, but strong epistatic interactions among genes make the fitness landscape rugged and prevent more complex patterns from being produced.

Predictions about robotic missions to the planet Mars have described such site preparation as essential to the success of later mission objectives, such as the construction of solar arrays, etc. This algorithm was based on a behaviour observed in a particular species of ant called "blind bulldozing." We developed a mathematical model of bund bulldozing using a unique approach based on Markov chains. Robot bulldozers were developed and used to test the algorithm in our laboratory. The team of robots was found to be successful at clearing an open area out of a field of rocks. Our robots' behaviour also agreed with the predictions of our model. This work is significant because it demonstrates the viability of blind bulldozing and represents the first time, to our knowledge, that a multiple robot system has carried out a form of the general construction task outside of simulation.},

abstract = {The distributed control of self-assembly processes requires local behaviors that will cause initially unorganized components to form a desired goal structure. While important strides have been made in designing methods for self-assembling various geometric structures under idealized simulated conditions, many unaddressed issues remain in extending these methods to more complex environments. In this work, we discuss the self-assembly of prespecified 3D structures from blocks of different sizes. Block movements through a continuous environment are constrained by each other and simulated gravity, adding to the problem's difficulty. We present a solution that integrates three distinct techniques from the field of swarm intelligence: stigmergic pattern recognition, force-based movement control, and coordination via local message passing and state changes. Further, we empirically demonstrate that a stochastic component in the blocks' acceleration can aid in preventing persistent interference, and that the use of collective, flock-like movements can be beneficial in situations of low block availability. This work provides insight into the dynamics of continuous-space self-assembly, and is a step towards the design of methods for the automated "growth" of useful structures in real-world environments. {\textcopyright} 2006 - IOS Press and the authors(s).

ABSTRACT={Many insect species, and even some vertebrates, assemble their bodies to form multi-functional materials that combine sensing, computation, and actuation. The tower-building behavior of red imported fire ants, Solenopsis invicta, presents a key example of this phenomenon of collective construction. While biological studies of collective construction focus on behavioral assays to measure the dynamics of formation and studies of swarm robotics focus on developing hardware that can assemble and interact, algorithms for designing such collective aggregations have been mostly overlooked. We address this gap by formulating an agent-based model for collective tower-building with a set of behavioral rules that incorporate local sensing of neighboring agents. We find that an attractive force makes tower building possible. Next, we explore the trade-offs between attraction and random motion to characterize the dynamics and phase transition of the tower building process. Lastly, we provide an optimization tool that may be used to design towers of specific shapes, mechanical loads, and dynamical properties, such as mechanical stability and mobility of the center of mass.}

Here, we develop and test a three-dimensional agent-based model of this process that places realistic constraints on the diffusion of pheromones, the movement of termites, and the integrity of the architecture that they construct. The following scenarios are modelled: the use of a pheromone template in the construction of a simple royal chamber, the effect of wind on this process, and the construction of covered pathways. We consider the role of the third dimension and the effect of logistic constraints on termite behaviour and, reciprocally, the structures that they create. For instance, when agents find it difficult to reach some elevated or exterior areas of the growing structure, building proceeds at a reduced rate in these areas, ultimately influencing the range of termite-buildable architectures.",

abstract = {We present a decentralized, scalable approach to assembling a group of heterogeneous parts into different products using a swarm of robots. While the assembly plans are predetermined, the exact sequence of assembly of parts and the allocation of subassembly tasks to robots are determined by the interactions between robots in a decentralized fashion in real time. Our approach is based on developing a continuous abstraction of the system derived from models of chemical reactions and formulating the strategy as a problem of selecting rates of assembly and disassembly. These rates are mapped onto probabilities that determine stochastic control policies for individual robots, which then produce the desired aggregate behavior. This top-down approach to determining robot controllers also allows us to optimize the rates at the abstract level to achieve fast convergence to the specified target numbers of products. Because the method incorporates programs for assembly and disassembly, changes in demand can lead to reconfiguration in a seamless fashion. We illustrate the methodology using a physics-based simulator with examples involving 15 robots and two types of final products.},
