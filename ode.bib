  abstract ={Diffusion of transported particles in the intracellular medium is described by means of a generalized diffusion equation containing forces due to the cytoskeleton network and to the protein motors. We find that the enhanced diffusion observed in experiments depends on the nature of the force exerted by the protein motors and on parameters characterizing the intracellular medium which is described in terms of a generalized Debye spectrum for the noise density of states.},

  abstract ={We investigate the challenges and limitations that are encountered when studying membrane protein dynamics in vivo by means of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). Based on theoretical arguments and computer simulations, we show that, in general, the fluctuating fluorescence has a fractal dimension D0 ≥ 1.5, which is determined by the anomality α of the diffusional motion of the labeled particles, i.e., by the growth of their mean square displacement as (Δx)2 ∼ tα. The fractality enforces an initial power-law behavior of the autocorrelation function and related quantities for small times. Using this information, we show by FCS that Golgi resident membrane proteins move subdiffusively in the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus in vivo. Based on Monte Carlo simulations for FCS on curved surfaces, we can rule out that the observed anomalous diffusion is a result of the complex topology of the membrane. The apparent mobility of particles as determined by FCS, however, is shown to depend crucially on the shape of the membrane and its motion in time. Due to this fact, the hydrodynamic radius of the tracked particles can be easily overestimated by an order of magnitude.},

  abstract ={A stochastic random walk model of protein molecule diffusion on a cell membrane was used to investigate the fundamental causes of anomalous diffusion in two-dimensional biological media. Three different interactions were considered: collisions with fixed obstacles, picket fence posts, and capture by, or exclusion from, lipid rafts. If motion is impeded by randomly placed, fixed obstacles, we find that diffusion can be highly anomalous, in agreement with previous studies. In contrast, collision with picket fence posts has a negligible effect on the anomalous exponent at realistic picket fence parameters. The effects of lipid rafts are more complex. If proteins partition into lipid rafts there is a small to moderate effect on the anomalous exponent, whereas if proteins are excluded from rafts there is a large effect on the anomalous exponent. In combination, these mechanisms can explain the level of anomaly in experimentally observed membrane diffusion, suggesting that anomalous diffusion is caused by multiple mechanisms whose effects are approximately additive. Finally, we show that the long-range diffusion rate, Dmacro, estimated from fluorescence recovery after photobleaching studies, can be much smaller than Dmicro, the small-scale diffusion rate, and is highly sensitive to obstacle densities and other impeding structures.},

  abstract ={Modern microscopic techniques following the stochastic motion of labelled tracer particles have uncovered significant deviations from the laws of Brownian motion in a variety of animate and inanimate systems. Such anomalous diffusion can have different physical origins, which can be identified from careful data analysis. In particular, single particle tracking provides the entire trajectory of the traced particle, which allows one to evaluate different observables to quantify the dynamics of the system under observation. We here provide an extensive overview over different popular anomalous diffusion models and their properties. We pay special attention to their ergodic properties, highlighting the fact that in several of these models the long time averaged mean squared displacement shows a distinct disparity to the regular, ensemble averaged mean squared displacement. In these cases, data obtained from time averages cannot be interpreted by the standard theoretical results for the ensemble averages. Here we therefore provide a comparison of the main properties of the time averaged mean squared displacement and its statistical behaviour in terms of the scatter of the amplitudes between the time averages obtained from different trajectories. We especially demonstrate how anomalous dynamics may be identified for systems, which, on first sight, appear to be Brownian. Moreover, we discuss the ergodicity breaking parameters for the different anomalous stochastic processes and showcase the physical origins for the various behaviours. This Perspective is intended as a guidebook for both experimentalists and theorists working on systems, which exhibit anomalous diffusion.},

  abstract ={A topic of intense current investigation pursues the question of how the highly crowded environment of biological cells affects the dynamic properties of passively diffusing particles. Motivated by recent experiments we report results of extensive simulations of the motion of a finite sized tracer particle in a heterogeneously crowded environment made up of quenched distributions of monodisperse crowders of varying sizes in finite circular two-dimensional domains. For given spatial distributions of monodisperse crowders we demonstrate how anomalous diffusion with strongly non-Gaussian features arises in this model system. We investigate both biologically relevant situations of particles released either at the surface of an inner domain or at the outer boundary, exhibiting distinctly different features of the observed anomalous diffusion for heterogeneous distributions of crowders.Specifically we reveal an asymmetric spreading of tracers even at moderate crowding. In addition to the mean squared displacement (MSD) and local diffusion exponent we investigate the magnitude and the amplitude scatter of the time averaged MSD of individual tracer trajectories, the non-Gaussianity parameter, and the van Hove correlation function. We also quantify how the average tracer diffusivity varies with the position in the domain with a heterogeneous radial distribution of crowders and examine the behaviour of the survival probability and the dynamics of the tracer survival probability. Inter alia, the systems we investigate are related to the passive transport of lipid molecules and proteins in two-dimensional crowded membranes or the motion in colloidal solutions or emulsions in effectively two-dimensional geometries, as well as inside supercrowded, surface adhered cells.},

  abstract ={An environment can be searched far more efficiently if the appropriate search strategy is used. Because of the limited individual abilities of swarm robots, namely, local sensing and low processing power, random searching is the main search strategy used in swarm robotics. The random walk methods that are used most commonly are Brownian motion and Lévy flight, both of which mimic the self-organized behavior of social insects. However, both methods are somewhat limited when applied to swarm robotics, where having the robots search repeatedly can result in highly inefficient searching. Therefore, by analyzing the characteristics of swarm robotic exploration, this paper proposes an improved random walk method in which each robot adjusts its step size adaptively to reduce the number of repeated searches by estimating the density of robots in the environment. Simulation experiments and experiments with actual robots are conducted to study the effectiveness of the proposed method and evaluate its performance in an exploration mission. The experimental results presented in this paper show that an area is covered more efficiently using the proposed method than it is using either Brownian motion or Lévy flight.

Two notable examples are the diffusion of membrane receptors and the kinetics of transcription factors governing the rates of gene expression. Different fluorescence imaging techniques have emerged to study molecular dynamics.

The analysis of SPT and FCS is an ongoing effort, and despite decades of work, much progress remains to be done.

The agents use memory to estimate the global state of the system from individual observations and adjust their actions accordingly. We also present a mathematical model of the dynamics of collective behavior in such systems and apply it to study adaptive coalition formation in electronic marketplaces. In adaptive coalition formation, the agents are more likely to join smaller coalitions than larger ones while there are many small coalitions. The rationale behind this is that smaller coalitions are necessary to nucleate larger ones. The agents remember the sizes of coalition they encountered and use them to estimate the mean coalition size. They decide whether to join a new coalition based on how close its size is to the mean coalition size. We show that the adaptive system displays most of the features of the non-adaptive one, but results in better long term system performance.},

abstract = {Dynamic task allocation is an essential requirement for multi-robot systems operating in unknown dynamic environments. It allows robots to change their behavior in response to environmental changes or actions of other robots in order to improve overall system performance. Emergent coordination algorithms for task allocation that use only local sensing and no direct communication between robots are attractive because they are robust and scalable. However, a lack of formal analysis tools makes emergent coordination algorithms difficult to design. In this paper we present a mathematical model of a general dynamic task allocation mechanism. Robots using this mechanism have to choose between two types of tasks, and the goal is to achieve a desired task division in the absence of explicit communication and global knowledge. Robots estimate the state of the environment from repeated local observations and decide which task to choose based on these observations. We model the robots and observations as stochastic processes and study the dynamics of the collective behavior. Specifically, we analyze the effect that the number of observations and the choice of the decision function have on the performance of the system. The mathematical models are validated in a multi-robot multi-foraging scenario. The model's predictions agree very closely with results of embodied simulations.},

There is no explicit communication or coordination between the robots. Unlike microscopic simulations (sensor-based or using a probabilistic numerical model), in which computational time scales with the robot group size, the macroscopic model is computationally efficient, because its solutions are independent of robot group size. Analysis reproduces several qualitative conclusions of Ijspeert et al.: namely, the different dynamical regimes for different values of the ratio of robots to sticks, the existence of optimal control parameters that maximize system performance as a function of group size, and the transition from superlinear to sublinear performance as the number of robots is increased. {\textcopyright} 2002 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

We present a mathematical model of foraging in a homogeneous multi-robot system, with the goal of understanding quantitatively the effects of interference. We examine two foraging scenarios: a simplified collection task where the robots only collect objects, and a foraging task, where they find objects and deliver them to some pre-specified ``home'' location. In the first case we find that the overall group performance improves as the system size grows; however, interference causes this improvement to be sublinear, and as a result, each robot's individual performance decreases as the group size increases. We also examine the full foraging task where robots collect objects and deliver them home. We find an optimal group size that maximizes group performance. For larger group sizes, the group performance declines. However, again due to the effects of interference, the individual robot's performance is a monotonically decreasing function of the group size. We validate both models by comparing their predictions to results of sensor-based simulations in a multi-robot system and find good agreement between theory and simulations data.},

In a two-dimensional biased random walk, the diffusion about the mean drift position is entirely dependent on the moments of the angular distribution used to determine the movement direction at each step. Here we consider biased random walks using several different angular distributions and derive expressions for the diffusion coefficients in each direction based on either a fixed or variable movement speed, and we use these to generate a probability density function for the long-time spatial distribution. We demonstrate how diffusion is typically anisotropic around the mean drift position and illustrate these theoretical results using computer simulations. We relate these results to earlier studies of swimming microorganisms and explain how the results can be generalized to other types of animal movement.},

	abstract = {We present a survey on the application of fluid approximations, in the form of mean-field models, to the design of control strategies in swarm robotics. Mean-field models that consist of ordinary differential equations, partial differential equations, and difference equations have been used in the swarm robotics literature, depending on whether the state of each agent and the time variable take values from a discrete or continuous set. These macroscopic models are independent of the number of agents in the swarm, and hence can be used to synthesize robot control strategies in a scalable manner, in contrast to individual-based microscopic models of swarms that represent finite numbers of discrete agents. Moreover, mean-field models are amenable to rigorous investigation using tools from dynamical systems theory, control theory, stochastic processes, and analysis of partial differential equations, enabling new insights and provable guarantees on the dynamics of collective behaviors. In this paper, we survey the applications of these models to problems in swarm robotics that include coverage, task allocation, self-assembly, consensus, and environmental mapping.}

@book{ODE:VanKampen2007,
  abstract = {Of late there is an increasing interest in fluctuating phenomena and stochastic methods describing them, and the present book is an attempt to consolidate such efforts. The book consists of 14 chapters and can be conveniently divided into four parts. Part I consists of 1. Stochastic variables, 2. Random events, 3. Stochastic processes and 4. Markov processes; Part II comprises 5. The master equation, 6. One-step processes, 7. Chemical reactions, and 8. The Fokker-Planck equations and Langevin equations; Part III contains 9. The expansion of the master equation, 10. The diffusion type, and 11. Unstable systems; Part IV deals with diverse topics: 12. Fluctuation in continuous systems, 13. Statistics of jump events, and 14. Stochastic differential equations.

The earliest work on stochastic processes with special reference to problems of physical sciences dates back to 1943, namely, Chandrasekhar's classic review article. There were practically no books written in this flavour until the decade commencing from 1960, by which time the use of stochastic processes had become very popular. Many books have appeared in print since then. The book under review is distinctively different from the existing ones in content and more particularly in the basic approach. Part I covers material of a classical type; even there the approach is very stimulating and a graduate student, particularly in physics or chemistry, will profit enormously by studying the material and working out the problems indicated here and there. Parts II and III cover a good amount of the work of the author himself and it is here that even specialists in the subject will find it worthwhile to read through. The topics treated in Part IV take the reader to the very specialized areas in the frontier of research. Discussions of some topics like statistics of jump events and stochastic differential equations are rather incomplete. The author would have done well to bring them to the same level as the rest of the book. For instance, the use of stochastic calculi in modeling is a significant omission. Likewise, the statistics of jump events could have been improved to include a full discussion on the response phenomena.

On the whole the reviewer found the book most enjoyable and the book can be recommended to applied probabilists, physicists and physical chemists. The graduate student, especially the one who aspires to do modeling in physical sciences, will find the book very inspiring. },

@article{ODE:Berman2009-distribution,
abstract = {We present a scalable approach to dynamically allocating a swarm of homogeneous robots to multiple tasks, which are to be performed in parallel, following a desired distribution. We employ a decentralized strategy that requires no communication among robots. It is based on the development of a continuous abstraction of the swarm obtained by modeling population fractions and defining the task allocation problem as the selection of rates of robot ingress and egress to and from each task. These rates are used to determine probabilities that define stochastic control policies for individual robots, which, in turn, produce the desired collective behavior. We address the problem of computing rates to achieve fast redistribution of the swarm subject to constraint(s) on switching between tasks at equilibrium. We present several formulations of this optimization problem that vary in the precedence constraints between tasks and in their dependence on the initial robot distribution. We use each formulation to optimize the rates for a scenario with four tasks and compare the resulting control policies using a simulation in which 250 robots redistribute themselves among four buildings to survey the perimeters.},

@incollection{ODE:Berman2007-synthesis,
abstract = {We present a methodology for characterizing, analyzing, and synthesizing swarm behaviors using both a macroscopic continuous model that represents a swarm as a continuum and a macroscopic discrete model that enumerates individual agents. Our methodology is applied to a dynamical model of ant house hunting, a decentralized process in which a colony attempts to emigrate to the best site among several alternatives. The model is hybrid because the colony switches between different sets of behaviors, or modes, during this process. Using the model in [1], we investigate the relation of site population growth to initial system state with an algorithm called Multi-Affine Reachability analysis using Conical Overapproximations (MARCO) [2]. We then derive a microscopic hybrid dynamical model of an agent that respects the specifications of the global behavior at the continuous level. Our multi-level simulations demonstrate that we have produced a rigorously correct microscopic model from the macroscopic descriptions.},
