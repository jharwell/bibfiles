abstract = {This paper reports, for the first time, the computational performance of SequenceL for mesoscale simulations of large numbers of particles in a microfluidic device via the lattice-Boltzmann method. The performance of SequenceL simulations was assessed against the optimized serial and parallelized (via OpenMP directives) FORTRAN90 simulations. At present, OpenMP directives were not included in inter-particle and particle–wall repulsive (steric) interaction calculations due to difficulties that arose from inter-iteration dependencies between consecutive iterations of the do-loops. SequenceL simulations, on the other hand, relied on built-in automatic parallelism. Under these conditions, numerical simulations revealed that the parallelized FORTRAN90 outran the performance of SequenceL by a factor of 2.5 or more when the number of particles was 100 or less. SequenceL, however, outran the performance of the parallelized FORTRAN90 by a factor of 1.3 when the number of particles was 300. Our results show that when the number of particles increased by 30-fold, the computational time of SequenceL simulations increased linearly by a factor of 1.5, as compared to a 3.2-fold increase in serial and a 7.7-fold increase in parallelized FORTRAN90 simulations. Considering SequenceL's efficient built-in parallelism that led to a relatively small increase in computational time with increased number of particles, it could be a promising programming language for computationally-efficient mesoscale simulations of large numbers of particles in microfluidic experiments.},

abstract = {Modern intelligent systems researchers form hypotheses about system behavior, and then run experiments using one or more independent variables to test their hypotheses. We present SIERRA, a novel framework structured around that idea for accelerating research developments and improving reproducibility of results. SIERRA makes it easy to quickly specify the independent variable(s) for an experiment, generate experimental inputs, automatically run the experiment, and process the results to generate deliverables such as graphs and videos. SIERRA provides reproducible automation independent of the execution environment (HPC hardware, real robots, etc.) and targeted platform (arbitrary simulator or real robots), enabling exact experiment replication (up to the limit of the execution environment and platform). It employs a deeply modular approach that allows easy customization and extension of automation for the needs of individual researchers, thereby eliminating manual experiment configuration and result processing via throw-away scripts.},
