abstract={We present SIERRA, a novel framework for accelerating development and
  improving reproducibility of results in robotics research. SIERRA accelerates
  research by automating the process of generating experiments from queries over
  independent variables(s), executing experiments, and processing the results to
  generate deliverables such as graphs and videos. It shifts the paradigm for
  testing hypotheses from procedural (``Do these steps to answer the query'') to
  declarative (``Here is the query to test---GO!''), reducing the burden on
  researchers. It employs a modular architecture enabling easy customization and
  extension for the needs of individual researchers, thereby eliminating manual
  configuration and processing via throw-away scripts.  SIERRA improves
  reproducibility of research by providing automation independent of the
  execution environment (HPC hardware, real robots, etc.) and targeted platform
  (simulator, real robots, etc.). This enables exact experiment replication, up
  to the limit of the execution environment and platform, as well as making it
  easy for researchers to test hypotheses in different computational
  environments. Though SIERRA is targeted at robotics research, its design makes
  it extendable to other fields.}

  problems such as repair of critical infrastructure of roads and levies after a

  problem, where independent agents must coordinate to concurrently manipulate
  aspects of a 3D environment without deadlocks. Extracting desirable properties
  of graphs representing natural 3D structures, we sketch a graphical

 abstract={We study the limits of linear modeling of swarm behavior by characterizing the inflection point beyond which linear models of swarm collective behavior break down. The problem we consider is a central place object gathering task. We design a linear model which strives to capture the underlying dynamics of object gathering in robot swarms from first principles, rather than extensively relying on post-hoc model fitting. We evaluate our model with swarms of up to 8,000 robots in simulation, demonstrating that it accurately captures underlying swarm behavioral dynamics when the swarm can be approximated using the mean-field model, and when it cannot, and finite-size effects are present. We further apply our model to swarms exhibiting non-linear behaviors, and show that it still provides accurate predictions in some scenarios, thereby establishing better practical limits on linear modeling of swarm behaviors. }

title = {Improved Swarm Engineering: Aligning Intuition and Analysis},
year = {2021},
abstract={We present a set of metrics intended to supplement designer intuitions when
  designing swarm-robotic systems to solve variants of object gathering
  problems, increase accuracy in extrapolating swarm behavior from algorithmic
  descriptions and small test experiments, and lead to faster and less costly
  design cycles. We build on previous works studying self-organizing behaviors
  in autonomous systems to derive a metric for swarm emergent self-organization.
  We utilize techniques from high performance computing, time series analysis,
  and queueing theory to derive metrics for swarm scalability, flexibility to
  changing external environments, and robustness to internal system stimuli such
  as sensor and actuator noise and robot failures.
  We demonstrate the utility of our metrics by analyzing four different control
  algorithms in two scenarios: an indoor warehouse object transport scenario
  with static objects and a spatially unconstrained outdoor search and rescue
  scenario with moving objects. In the spatially constrained warehouse scenario,
  efficient use of space is key to success so algorithms that use mechanisms for
  traffic regulation and congestion reduction are the most appropriate.  In the
  search and rescue scenario, the same will happen with algorithms which can
  cope well with object motion through dynamic task allocation and randomized
  search trajectories. We show that our intuitions about comparative algorithm
  performance are well supported by the quantitative results obtained using our
  metrics, and that our metrics can be synergistically used together to predict
  collective behaviors based on previous results in some cases.}

abstract = {We investigate the emergence of swarm intelligence using task allocation
in large robot swarms. First, we compare task decomposition graphs of different
levels of richness and measure the emergent intelligence arising from self-organized
task allocation by deriving STOCH-N1, a stochastic allocation algorithm which
contextualizes per-robot task allocation decisions based on a previous task's
neighborhood within the graph. The results are compared to other state of the
art algorithms. Second, we derive MAT-OPT: a greedy algorithm that optimally solves
the swarm task allocation problem by representing the swarm's task allocation
space as a matroid under some restrictive assumptions. We compare the MAT-OPT
allocation method, which disregards task dependencies, with STOCH-N1, which emphasizes
collective learning of graph structure (including dependencies). Results from
an object gathering task show that swarm emergent intelligence (1) is sensitive
to the richness of task decomposition graphs (2) is positively correlated with
performance, (3) arises out of learning and exploitation of graph connectivity
and structure, rather than graph content.}

However, in the current literature only a few papers consider energy allocation efficiency within a swarm. Generally, robots recharge to their maximum level every time unconditionally, and do not incorporate estimates of the energy needed for their next task. In this paper we present an energy efficiency maximization method that minimizes the overall energy cost within a swarm while simultaneously maximizing swarm performance on an object gathering task. The method utilizes dynamic thresholds for upper and lower battery limits. This method has also shown to improve the efficiency of existing energy management methods. }

abstract={Swarm robotics (SR) offers promising solutions to real-world problems that can be modeled as
  foraging tasks, e.g. disaster/trash cleanup or object gathering for construction. Yet current SR
  foraging approaches make limiting assumptions that restrict their applicability to selected
  real-world environments. We propose an improved self-organized task allocation method based on
  task partitioning that removes restrictions such as: (1) \emph{a priori} knowledge of foraging
  environment, and (2) strict limitations on intermediate drop/pickup site behavior. With
  experiments in simulation, we show that under the proposed constraint relaxation, our approach
  still provides performance increases when compared to an unpartitioned strategy within some
  combinations of swarm sizes, robot capabilities, and environmental conditions.  This work
  broadens the applicability of SR foraging approaches, showing that they can be effective under
  ideal conditions while continuing to perform robustly in more volatile/challenging environments.}

abstract = {This paper reports, for the first time, the computational performance of SequenceL for mesoscale simulations of large numbers of particles in a microfluidic device via the lattice-Boltzmann method. The performance of SequenceL simulations was assessed against the optimized serial and parallelized (via OpenMP directives) FORTRAN90 simulations. At present, OpenMP directives were not included in inter-particle and particle–wall repulsive (steric) interaction calculations due to difficulties that arose from inter-iteration dependencies between consecutive iterations of the do-loops. SequenceL simulations, on the other hand, relied on built-in automatic parallelism. Under these conditions, numerical simulations revealed that the parallelized FORTRAN90 outran the performance of SequenceL by a factor of 2.5 or more when the number of particles was 100 or less. SequenceL, however, outran the performance of the parallelized FORTRAN90 by a factor of 1.3 when the number of particles was 300. Our results show that when the number of particles increased by 30-fold, the computational time of SequenceL simulations increased linearly by a factor of 1.5, as compared to a 3.2-fold increase in serial and a 7.7-fold increase in parallelized FORTRAN90 simulations. Considering SequenceL's efficient built-in parallelism that led to a relatively small increase in computational time with increased number of particles, it could be a promising programming language for computationally-efficient mesoscale simulations of large numbers of particles in microfluidic experiments.},
