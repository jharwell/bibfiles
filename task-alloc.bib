abstract = {In this article we present a self-organized method for allocating the individuals of a robot swarm to tasks that are sequentially interdependent. Tasks that are sequentially interdependent are common in natural and artificial systems. The proposed method does neither rely on global knowledge nor centralized components. Moreover, it does not require the robots to communicate. The method is based on the delay experienced by the robots working on one subtask when waiting for input from another subtask. We explore the capabilities of the method in different simulated environments. Additionally, we evaluate the method in a proof-of-concept experiment using real robots. We show that the method allows a swarm to reach a near-optimal allocation in the studied environments, can easily be transferred to a real robot setting, and is adaptive to changes in the properties of the tasks such as their duration. Finally, we show that the ideal setting of the parameters of the method does not depend on the properties of the environment.},

abstract = {Task partitioning is the decomposition of a task into two or more sub-tasks that can be tackled separately. Task partitioning can be observed in many species of social in- sects, as it is often an advantageous way of organizing the work of a group of individuals. Potential advantages of task partitioning are, among others: reduction of interference be- tween workers, exploitation of individuals' skills and specializations, energy efficiency, and higher parallelism. Even though swarms of robots can benefit from task partitioning in the same way as social insects do, only few works in swarm robotics are dedicated to this sub- ject. In this paper, we study the case in which a swarm of robots has to tackle a task that can be partitioned into a sequence of two sub-tasks. We propose a method that allows the individual robots in the swarm to decide whether to partition the given task or not. The method is self-organized, relies on the experience of each individual, and does not require explicit communication between robots.We evaluate themethod in simulation experiments, using foraging as testbed.We study cases in which task partitioning is preferable and cases in which it is not. We show that the proposed method leads to good performance of the swarm in both cases, by employing task partitioning only when it is advantageous.We also show that the swarm is able to react to changes in the environmental conditions by adapting the behavior on-line. Scalability experiments show that the proposed method performs well across all the tested group sizes.},

abstract = {The performance of large groups of robots is often limited by a com-monly shared resource. This effect, termed interference, can have a large impact on robotic swarms. This article studies the issue of interference in a swarm of robots working on a harvesting task. The environment of the robots is spatially constrained, i.e., there is a commonly shared resource, the nest, which limits the group's performance when used without any arbitration mechanism. The article studies the use of task partitioning for reducing concurrent accesses to the resource, and therefore limiting the impact of interference on the group's performance. In our study, we spatially partition the environment into two subparts, thereby partitioning the corresponding harvesting task as well. We employ a sim-ple method to allocate individuals to the partitions. The approach is empirically studied both in an environment with a narrow nest area and an environment with-out this constraint. The results of the task partitioning strategy are analyzed and compared to the case in which task partitioning is not employed.},

abstract = {Task partitioning is a way of organizing work consisting in the decomposition of a task into smaller sub-tasks that can be tackled separately. Task partitioning can be beneficial in terms of reduction of physical interference, increase of efficiency, higher parallelism, and ex-ploitation of specialization. However, task partitioning also entails costs in terms of coordination efforts and overheads that can reduce its bene-fits. It is therefore important to decide when to make use of task parti-tioning. In this paper we show that such a decision can be formulated as a multi-armed bandit problem. This is advantageous since the theoret-ical properties of the multi-armed bandit problem are well understood and several algorithms have been proposed for tackling it. We carry out our study in simulation, using a swarm robotics foraging scenario as a testbed. We test an ad-hoc algorithm and two algorithms proposed in the literature for multi-armed bandit problems. The results confirm that the problem of selecting whether to partition a task can be formulated as a multi-armed bandit problem and tackled with existing algorithms.},
